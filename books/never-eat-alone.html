<h1>
	Never Eat Alone
</h1>

<p>I hate networking. I hate the entire thought of meeting people exclusively to grow in a business sense. Never eat alone is an anti-networking book. It's about bulding meaningful relationships and creating something with them. The <i>only</i> networking book you'll need.</p><br>

<div class="notes">

	<ol>
	<li><b>Community is the most valuable form of social capital</b>: spurs collaboration while satisfying a deeply human need</li>
	<li><b>Success=People you meet+What you create together</b></li>
	<li>Everything exists solely in relationship to everything else.</li>
	<li>Poverty isn’t solely a lack of resources, but also isolation from the people who can help you out of poverty</li>
	<li><b>Key to networking is generosity.</b> Don’t keep score- reciprocity will work its magic.<b> Find ways to make others successful.</b> This builds trust, vitally important for any relationship.</li>
	<li><b>You also need to be able to ask for generosity.</b> Giving help is only half the equation. If you can’t ask for it when you need it, you’re hung out to dry.</li>
	<li><b>The more specific you are about what you want, the easier it is to accomplish</b>. "<i>A goal is a dream with a deadline."</i></li>
	<li><b>Blue Flame:</b> A convergence of mission and passion, founded on a realistic self-assessment of your abilities.</li>
	<li><b>Steps to find your blue flame:</b>
	<ol>
	<li>Write down dream (no matter how preposterous) then write down things which bring you joy and pleasure.</li>
	<li>Ask close friends for your greatest strengths and weaknesses.</li>
	<li>List what you’d like to accomplish in 3 years. Work back in 1 year and 3 month increments to realize action plans.</li>
	<li>Name people who can help get you closer to your goal.</li>
	<li>Find a way to be generous to every person you reach out to.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Goals must be specific. They must be challenging and demanding.</li>
	<li>Current ways to get involved:
	<ol>
	<li>Create a company approved project working to grow skills and meet others in your company.</li>
	<li>Take on leadership positions in the hobbies and organizations that interest you.</li>
	<li>Join your alumni club</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>The law of probability ensures <b>the more new people you know, the more opportunities will come your way. </b></li>
	<li>It never hurts to ask. Breeds opportunity. A low propensity for risk correlates to a low propensity for success. "<i>There is genius, even kindness, in being bold."</i></li>
	<li>Initiate with new people on a weekly basis. </li>
	<li>In reaching out: state the situation, communicate your feelings, deliver the bottom line, end with an open ended question. </li>
	<li><b>It's better to spend more time with fewer people.</b> Meaningful dialogues matter. Be transparent. </li>
	<li>Don't network, make friends. </li>
	<li><b>Prepare one page synopsis on someone you're going to meet.</b> Aim to know what they're like, where their passions are. Understand how to build a meaningful relationship with them</li>
	<li><b>Networking goals:</b> map out most important players, determine influencers, make a list of potential customers/acquirers. Name actual people. </li>
	<li>Make every call warm. You must persist to get in touch:
	<ol>
	<li>state connection</li>
	<li>state value prop.</li>
	<li>impart urgency to your meeting.</li>
	<li>be prepared to compromise.</li>
	<li>Always have a call to action.  </li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>Credibility translates to trust. </b></li>
	<li><b>Talk a little and say a lot. </b></li>
	<li><b>Make gatekeepers allies. </b></li>
	<li>Group meetings together to meet more people, add value. </li>
	<li>Meet people around your passions. <b>Friendships are created around quality of time.</b> You can also tell more about how someone will react in business from a workout or dinner.</li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(255, 38, 0);"><b>**Activities to Build Over</b>:</span> Coffee, conferences, workouts/hobbies, meal or drinks, Special Events (make it interesting and fun), Dinner Parties/Your Home, Volunteer together</li>
	</ol>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div><span style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Conferences</b></span></div>
	<ol>
	<li><b>Follow-Up</b>: First is generally best. W/i 12-24 hours. Include a reference to convo, reaffirm commitments, be brief. Handwritten notes go a long way.</li>
	<li><b>**Conference Networking:</b>
	<ul>
	<li>Offer to help the organizer<br/>
	Offer to speak</li>
	<li>ask questions (introduce yourself, company, and ask a deep one)</li>
	<li>organize your own dinners/invite people to your home</li>
	<li>speak to big players(<i>before</i> speaking)</li>
	<li>Research and share information</li>
	<li>Master the <i>deep bump.</i></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Deep Bump:</b> brief encounter where you deeply connect, ask questions beyond business, and reveal vulnerability.</li>
	<li>Merge your network with other connectors, co-host events. <b>Must be a win-win.</b></li>
	<li><b>Small Talk tips:</b>
	<ul>
	<li>Be yourself</li>
	<li>DON’T make small talk</li>
	<li>relax, nod your head and lean in, smile, maintain a healthy degree of eye contact</li>
	<li><b>Learn to Touch:</b> Shake with two hands, touch the others elbow/upper arm.</li>
	<li><b>Have something to say</b></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Johari Window:</b> Succesful communication depends on our ability to align how open we are with how open the others are/expect. <b>Be a Mirror</b>.</li>
	<li><b>In Exiting:</b> Affirm your desire to follow-up, politely express desire to meet more people (see book for example). <span style="color: rgb(255, 38, 12);"><b>ALWAYS REMEMBER NAMES.</b></span></li>
	<li>Discover someone’s motivations.  Generally: Making money, finding love, or changing the world. <b>Every person is an opportunity to help and be helped.</b> Make them feel important.</li>
	<li><b>Biggest impact:</b> <b>Health, Wealth, and Children</b>. Helps fulfill basic needs and move up the hierarchy.</li>
	<li><b>Success comes to those who give freely but also maintain self-interest</b>. They give to givers, feed their network, and calendar time for giving. <b>Look for quick favors that are high-impact</b>.<b> Don’t wait to be asked to give, just give</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Strength of network= quality+quantity+diversity</b>. Who you know determines how effectively you can apply what you know. </li>
	<li><b>In building new relationships:</b>
	<ul>
	<li>People should see you in three modes</li>
	<li>contact at least once a month</li>
	<li>Two face-to-face meetings for a friend</li>
	<li>Secondary relationships require 2-3 contacts a year.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Call on Birthdays: POWER-PING.</b> This means more than you can understand. <i>I’ve tested this, and it’s true. Cal your friends on their birthdays.</i> </li>
	<li><b>Find individuals with access to higher networks that are also accessibl</b>e: Mentors, bosses, teachers, etc. Anyone who can add electricity. <i>Thursdays are great for dinner parties.</i></li>
	<li><b>Dinner Parties:</b>
	<ul>

	<li>have a theme</li>
	<li>one big dish and LOTS of alcohol (wine)</li>
	<li>create atmosphere.</li>
	<li>Simple is better.</li>
	<li>Host a virtual after-party (e-mail pics and party highlights).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	</ol>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div><span style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Internet</b></span></div>
	<ol>

	<li>Trust=generosity + vulnerability + accountability + candor</li>
	<li><b>Subject lines should imply utility or curiosity.</b> Think, how can I helpful to people? Create value.</li>
	</ol>
	<div><br/></div>

	<li><b>Focus less on “to-dos” than “to-meets"</b></li>
	<li>Get in front of key influencers. Come to newspeople with interesting stories, not just self-promotional. <b>Always thank people for their work</b>.</li>
	<li>Go for mice all day and a lion will still starve. <b>Treat famous people like people, don’t pester them</b>. </li>
	<li>Political fundraisers, associations, and non-profits to meet people.</li>
	<li><b>You learn in your twenties and earn in your thirties.</b></li>
	<li>Bring people together to make the world a better place. Be the best in the world to be the best for the world.</li>
