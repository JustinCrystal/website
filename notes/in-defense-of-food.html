<h1>
	In Defense of Food
</h1>

<p>Food and nutrition are so damn confusing... Or are they? Michael Pollan lays out a few incredibly simple rules for how to think about your diet and food, with history to explain why things are the way they are. Want to skip the history? Jump to part three to get the rules for eating well.</p><br>

	<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><b>I. The Age of Nutritionism</b></span></div>
	<div><b><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></b></div>
	<div>Eat food. Not much. Mostly Plants.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>A little meat won’t kill you, but it’s better approached as a side dish, and you’re better off eating whole fresh foods than anything processed.</div>
	<div><b><br/></b></div>
	<div><b>If you’re concerned about your health, you should probably avoid any food making a health claim.</b> A health claim on food is a strong indication that it’s not really food.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Also, fun fact- it tends to be that the best ethical and environmental choices align with what is best for your health.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Many of the chronic diseases that now kill most of us can be traced directly to the industrialization of our food:</div>
	<ul>
	<li>The rise of highly process food and grains</li>
	<li>use of chemicals to raise plants and animals in large monocultures</li>
	<li>superabundance of cheap calories of fat and sugar</li>
	<li>narrowing of biodiversity if the human diet to a handful of staples crops (corn, wheat, and soy)</li>
	</ul>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Humans have historically been very healthy on a variety of diets, so most of the current damage can be reversed. </div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div><span style="font-size: 18px;"><b>From Foods to Nutrients</b></span></div>
	<div><b><span style="font-size: 18px;"><br/></span></b></div>
	<div><i>tl;dr:</i> The modern focus on “nutrients” is largely politically lobbied bullshit, where interested industries tried to take the focus away from their product and placed on nutrients.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>In January 1977, the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs did a study on the health of americans. <b>They advised americans to “eat less meat and dairy”, but within week a firestorm of criticism from the meat and dairy industry got it rewritten to  “choose meats, poultry, and fish that will reduce saturated fat intake”.</b> Issues with this:</div>
	<ul>
	<li>The message to eat less was removed— you still to date can’t tell people to eat less of a food without an industry eating you for lunch</li>
	<li>It set a precedent of speaking no more of food, but only nutrients<b> </b></li>
	<li>There wasn’t a wide body of evidence that saturated fat was the problem, only the sheer amount of meat being consumed</li>
	<li><b>Most evidence in studies points to foods, not individual nutrients.</b> But now results can only be framed in terms of nutrients.</li>
	<li>The report clarified the benefits of antioxidants in vegetables rather than the vegetables themselves</li>
	</ul>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div><b>Nutritionism:</b> The idea that foods are essentially a sum of their nutritional parts.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>This is fundamentally untrue, food is a complex biological and chemical entity that has thousands of relationships happening.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>The lipid hypothesis- that fats were the problem and a low fat diet would be the answer, is the biggest blow to the nutritionist movement. The book has a great argument for this, I’ll spare the detail here.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div><b>The problem with nutritionism:</b></div>
	<ul>
	<li>Scientists study variables they can isolate, it’s the only way to come to a meaningful conclusion.</li>
	<li>Even the simplest food is a hopelessly complex combination of chemical compounds existing in intricate and dynamic relation to one another</li>
	<li>People don’t eat nutrients, they eat food. And food behaves very differently than the nutrients consumed.</li>
	<li>A lot of research has revealed that removing crucial molecules from the food involved (vitamins, antioxidants) greatly reduces their effectiveness.</li>
	<li>Nutritionist bases it’s hypotheses that we face too much of a bad thing (saturated fat) rather than too little of a good (whole foods).</li>
	<li>Dietary trials generally fail- people cheat and lie about what they do, there isn’t a real control/experimental group</li>
	</ul>
	<div><b><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></b></div>
	<div><b><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></b></div>
	<div><b><span style="font-size: 24px;">II. The Western Diet and the Diseases of Civilization</span></b></div>
	<div><b><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></b></div>
	<div>The main features of the western diet:</div>
	<ol>
	<li>Lots of processed food and meats</li>
	<li>Lots of added fats and sugars</li>
	<li>Lots of anything except fruits, vegetables, and whole grains</li>
	</ol>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div>Many new populations, when introduced to the western diet, suffer from the same western diseases: Diabetes, Heart Disease, Obesity, higher cancer rates</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div><b>The health of the food is related to the entire food web:</b> Compromised health in one are (say the soil) cascades to every other area of the food chain- the grasses that grow from it and therefore the cows that eat it, also the vegetables that grow from it which we eat.</div>
	<div><br/></div>
	<div><b>The issue with nutrition less white foods:</b> There’s a destructive feedback loop: The more low quality foods one eats, the more they desire to eat to get quality vitamins, minerals, and nutrients.</div>
