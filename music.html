		<p>While I never actually played in Early Bird (well, aside from an improptu performance where I was invited on stage to drum to a song I had <i>never</i> played before), it was one of the most ambitious musical projects I've worked on to date.<br><br> As project manager of their <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/early-bird-s-first-album#/"><b>Indiegogo Campaign</b></a>, I raised nearly $3,000 for their debut album- no, not a teasure trove of cash, but for a small band from Syracuse, NY it was a lot. Check out their campaign video that I directed, shot, and produced or the final cut of the album!</p>

		<p>What started as a college rock band playing for drunk dancers at parties quickly became one of the most mature musical projects I'd ever played in. The journey included kickstarting and self-producing an album, winning $1,000 and free recording time at a NYS collegiate battle of the bands and a hell of a lot of fun in the process.<br><br> I acted as drummer, producer, and even did some mixing and mastering on a live EP. If you want to hear the single we made with the recording time we won, hit play below, or check out our other single and live EP by hitting play above.</p>

		<h2>Justin & Jesse</h2>

		<p>Justin&Jesse was my initial foray into video work, starting with a horribly done cover filmed exlusively on iPhones (and no, we didn't know how to use them). That being said, the project was constantly evolving- we made some videos that I will forever be proud of and some memories I won't soon forget. I've included my two favorites here.</p>
